# Custom Mobs (old method)

{% hint style="danger" %}
## This feature was removed in 4.0.10
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
This is the old method to create entities.\
It still works but this method has some limitations, that's why I implemented a new way to create custom mobs/entities.
{% endhint %}
