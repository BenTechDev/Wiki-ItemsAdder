# Recipes book problems

{% hint style="info" %}
These limitations are valid for EVERY Spigot plugin that creates custom recipes with custom items as ingredients, it's not an ItemsAdder bug and I can't fix it in any way.

Please don't report these bugs, I can't really do anything to fix this problem, it's a Minecraft limitation.
