# Using Filenames

To use item states, you need to add suffixes to your model filename (`generate: false`) **or** texture filename (`generate: true`).

## Suffixes for items

* `BOW`
  * `_0` - First pulling state
  * `_1` - Second pulling state
  * `_2` - Third pulling state
* `CROSSBOW`
  * `_0` - First pulling state
  * `_1` - Second pulling state
  * `_2` - Third pulling state
  * `_charged` - A charged crossbow with an arrow
  * `_firework` - A charged crossbow with a firework
* `FISHING_ROD`
  * `_cast` - Shows a fishing rod when it is cast
* `SHIELD`
  * `_blocking` - Shows a shield model when you are blocking with it
* `BUNDLE`
  * `_filled` - Displays a bundle when it is filled

## Adding item states using suffixes (bow)

Firstly you need to create three pulling states for our bow

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/bow\_pulling\_states.gif)

Save them, drop to the directory where is your original bow texture and add suffixes to your textures like this:

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/bow\_suffixes\_textures.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Suffixes also work on model names

{% endhint %}

## Done

You have working bow with item states
