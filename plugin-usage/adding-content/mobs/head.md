You can specify a bone to be marked as head and rotate automatically when the base entity AI rotates its head.

## Setup

### Configure the head bone

Open your `.iaentitymodel` model file with **Blockbench**.

Select the base bone of the head.

Rightclick on the bone and select "**Bone Config**"

Check the "**Head**" option and press "**Confirm**".\
You can also decide max angles for X and Y rotation.

The head bone is now marked as head, as you can see (the smiley face is the head bone).

Now you have to export the model as usual.
