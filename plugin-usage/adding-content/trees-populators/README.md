# 🌳 树木生成器

## 在世界中生成自定义树木

First read this tutorial on creating the tree blocks (leaved and wood)

{% hint style="danger" %}
### End dimension

It's advised **not** to **spawn** the trees in the **END** dimension because it has _some_ **problems**.

### 原版树木的漏洞

Sometimes trees will spawn with vanilla leaves, this is a known issue and I have no solution for this. Seems to be  a Minecraft/Spigot bug, seems an event used by IA sometimes is not triggered.

### Big trees lag

Big trees COULD cause some lag on generation, please use only small tree types.

### 其他问题
{% endhint %}
